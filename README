This YAML file defines a GitHub Actions workflow that automates the process of deploying an Amazon DocumentDB cluster within a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS. The workflow is triggered when there is a push to the 'main' branch of the repository.

Here’s a step-by-step guide to setting up this workflow:

Step 1: Set Up AWS IAM Credentials
        
        Create IAM User:
           Create a new user with programmatic access.

        Attach Permissions:
           Attach necessary permissions (e.g., AmazonEC2FullAccess, AmazonDocDBFullAccess, AmazonVPCFullAccess) to this user.

        Generate Access Keys:
           After creating the user, generate access keys (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).

        Store AWS Credentials in GitHub Secrets:
           Go to your GitHub repository.
           Navigate to Settings > Secrets > Actions.
           Add new secrets for AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.


Step 2: Create GitHub Actions Workflow
 
        Create a Workflow File:
           In your GitHub repository, create a file in .github/workflows directory. For example, .github/workflows/deploy-docdb.yml.

        Define Workflow Configuration:
           The YAML file will define the steps for deploying the DocumentDB cluster.


Step 3: Commit and Push Changes

        Add the Workflow File:
           Save the workflow file as .github/workflows/deploy-docdb.yml.

        Commit and Push:
           command: git add .github/workflows/deploy-docdb.yml
                    git commit -m "Add GitHub Actions workflow for DocumentDB deployment"
                    git push origin main


Step 4: Monitor the Workflow

        Go to GitHub Actions:
           Navigate to the Actions tab of your GitHub repository to see the workflow runs.

        Review Logs:
           Click on the workflow run to review the logs and ensure the deployment steps completed successfully.




{By following these steps, you’ll have a GitHub Actions workflow set up to automate the deployment of an Amazon DocumentDB cluster within a VPC on AWS.}
